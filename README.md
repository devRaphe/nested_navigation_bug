# Nested Navigation Bug.

## Getting Started

HELLO DANE, I HOPE YOU'RE WELL.
SO HERE IS THE REQUIRED APP THAT I MADE TO DEMONSTRATE A PROBLEM THAT I'M HAVING. I'VE TRIED TO KEEP IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE.
 - FIRST ISSUE IS THAT I CAN'T NAVIGATE TO A NESTED VIEW WITH A NAMED ROUTE, ONLY WIDGET ROUTING WORKS.

 - SECOND ISSUE IS THAT WHEN THE APP STARTS FROM THE [StartupView] AND NAVIGATES TO THE [MainView], AN ERROR IS THROWN WHICH IS "Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey."
 BUT WHEN APP'S INITIAL ROUTE IS SET TO [MainView] THEN THE ERROR IS NOT THROWN.

 I BELIEVE THIS SECOND ERROR HAS TO STILL DO WITH THE WAY
 THE NESTED NAVIGATION IS SETUP.
